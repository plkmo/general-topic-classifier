XLNET_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The XLNet model was proposed in
    `XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding`_
    by Zhilin Yang*, Zihang Dai*, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Quoc V. Le.
    XLnet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method
    to learn bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations
    of the input sequence factorization order.
    The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the `perm_mask` input.
    Do to the difficulty of training a fully auto-regressive model over various factorization order,
    XLNet is pretrained using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected
    with the `target_mapping` input.
    To use XLNet for sequential decoding (i.e. not in fully bi-directional setting), use the `perm_mask` and
    `target_mapping` inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in `examples/run_generation.py`)
    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and
    refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

XLNET_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`pytorch_transformers.XLNetTokenizer`.
            See :func:`pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            A parallel sequence of tokens (can be used to indicate various portions of the inputs).
            The embeddings from these tokens will be summed with the respective token embeddings.
            Indices are selected in the vocabulary (unlike BERT which has a specific vocabulary for segment indices).
        **attention_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
        **input_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Negative of `attention_mask`, i.e. with 0 for real tokens and 1 for padding.
            Kept for compatibility with the original code base.
            You can only uses one of `input_mask` and `attention_mask`
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are MASKED, ``0`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED.
        **mems**: (`optional`)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model
            (see `mems` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding and attend to longer context.
        **perm_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to indicate the attention pattern for each input token with values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            If ``perm_mask[k, i, j] = 0``, i attend to j in batch k;
            if ``perm_mask[k, i, j] = 1``, i does not attend to j in batch k.
            If None, each token attends to all the others (full bidirectional attention).
            Only used during pretraining (to define factorization order) or for sequential decoding (generation).
        **target_mapping**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, num_predict, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to indicate the output tokens to use.
            If ``target_mapping[k, i, j] = 1``, the i-th predict in batch k is on the j-th token.
            Only used during pretraining for partial prediction or for sequential decoding (generation).
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.

        **labels**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size,)``:
            Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss.
            Indices should be in ``[0, ..., config.num_labels]``.
            If ``config.num_labels == 1`` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss),

            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.
        **logits**: ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, config.num_labels)``
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) scores (before SoftMax).

            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model
            (see `mems` input above). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding and attend to longer context.
        **hidden_states**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for the output of each layer + the output of the embeddings)
            of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)``:
            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        **attentions**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_attentions=True``)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer) of shape ``(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)``:
